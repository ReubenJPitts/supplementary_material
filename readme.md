This folder contains the supplementary material for the doctoral dissertation "Language Contact and Language Change in a Multilingual Epigraphic Corpus: The Italian Peninsula in the First Millennium BCE".

## initialisation (working directory)

The Python code requires the working directory to be initialised to the parent folder of the supplementary material, e.g. using:

~~~
import os
os.chdir(r"~/supplementary_material")
~~~

Likewise for the R code:

~~~
setwd("~/supplementary_material")
~~~

Some of this code relies on external databases. For convenient use, the required files should be placed in their own folder within the parent folder, and given the following names:

* /CEIPoM                         (epigraphic database of ancient Italy)
* /WALS                           (general typological database)
* /WOLD                           (cross-linguistic loanword database)
* /PROIEL                         (treebank corpus of ancient Indo-European languages)

These files can be downloaded from the following locations:

* https://github.com/ReubenJPitts/Corpus-of-the-Epigraphy-of-the-Italian-Peninsula-in-the-1st-Millennium-BCE)
* https://github.com/cldf-datasets/wals
* https://github.com/lexibank/wold
* https://github.com/proiel/proiel-treebank

For each script, this readme will specify which external files are required, except for CEIPoM, which is integral to all of this research.

## initialisation (modules)

This folder contains two modules used by all subsequent code. These should be placed in the Python sys.path:

* CEIPoM_import.py                (imports CEIPoM database for use)
* treesearch.py                   (enables syntactic queries)

## datasets_manual

These datasets were created manually by the author, albeit in some cases by exporting them from external databases and then manually enriching the data.

* coordination_typology.csv       (created manually)
* italian_epigraphy.csv           (exported from Trismegistos and manually enriched)
* loanwords_italic.csv            (created manually)
* loanwords_sabellic.csv          (created manually)
* mediterranean_diversity.csv     (created manually)
* pairs_ancient.csv               (exported from CEIPoM and manually enriched)
* pairs_modern.csv                (exported from ASJD and manually enriched)
* typology.csv                    (created manually)

## datasets_scripts

This folder contains the code used to generate some of the datasets in the following section. 

* coordination_dataset.py         (uses CEIPoM files)
* loanwords_dataset.py            (uses "/datasets/italic_loanwords.csv", "/WOLD/forms.csv" and the PROIEL xmls)
* locative_dataset.py             (uses CEIPoM files)
* phonological_dataset.py         (uses "/datasets/pairs_modern.csv" and "/datasets/pairs_ancient.csv")
* syntax_datasets.py              (uses CEIPoM files)

The output datasets are, in each case, eponymous .csv files, except for syntax_datasets which produces five distinct datasets (order_accusative.csv, order_dative.csv, order_adverbial.csv, order_genitive, order_adjective).

## datasets_automatic

This contents contains datasets, which can be subdivided into three categories: datasets which were generated (or exported) automatically, datasets which were generated (or exported) automatically and then manually enriched, and datasets which were created manually from scratch. The datasets in question are the following:

* coordination_dataset.csv        (created automatically by coordination_dataset.py)
* loanwords_dataset.csv           (created automatically by locative_dataset.py)
* locative_dataset.csv            (created automatically by locative_dataset.py)
* order_accusative.csv            (created automatically by syntax_datasets.py)
* order_dative.csv                (created automatically by syntax_datasets.py)
* order_adverbial.csv             (created automatically by syntax_datasets.py)
* order_genitive.csv              (created automatically by syntax_datasets.py)
* order_adjective.csv             (created automatically by syntax_datasets.py)
* phonological_dataset.csv        (created automatically by phonological_dataset.py)

## datasets_enriched

One datasets from the folder "automatic_datasets" was manually enriched after having been generated by a Python script:

* order_adjective_enriched.csv    (created automatically by syntax_datasets.py and manually enriched)

## regression_scripts

Three R scripts are used for regression analyses, which are exported as csv files for effect plots to "regression_datasets". Please note that unlike the Python scripts (which use ";" for compatibility with Excel), these R scripts export "," separated .csv files to ensure decimal points are correctly reimported into the subsequent Python scripts.

* coordination_regression.R       (used in chapter 8)
* loanwords_regression.R          (used in chapter 5) TO COMPLETE
* syntax_regression.R             (used in chapter 6)

## regression_datasets

These csv files were created automatically by the regression analyses in "regression_scripts".

* effect_plot_coordination.csv    (created automatically by coordination_regression.R)
* effect_plot_date.csv            (created automatically by syntax_regression.R)
* effect_plot_date_mixed.csv      (created automatically by syntax_regression.R)
* effect_plot_language.csv        (created automatically by syntax_regression.R)
* effect_plot_language_mixed.csv  (created automatically by syntax_regression.R)
* effect_plot_loanwords.csv       (created automatically by coordination_regression.R) TO COMPLETE

## figures_scripts

These scripts are used to generate their eponymous png figures in "figures" (except typology.py, which generates multiple plots: "typology_dendrogram.png", "typology_heatmap.png", "typology_mds.png", "typology_mds_subsets.png").

* italian_adjective.png           (using order_adjective.csv)
* italian_adverbial.png           (using order_adverbial.csv)

* italian_genitive.png            (using order_genitive.csv)
* latin_accusative.py             (using order_accusative.csv)
* loanword_borrowability.py       (using loanwords_dataset.csv)
* loanword_source.py              (using loanwords_italic.csv)
* mediterranean_diversity.py      (using mediterranean_diversity.csv) SMALL EDITS NEEDED
* phonological_distances.py       (using phonological_dataset.csv)
* sabellic_locative.py            (using locative_dataset.csv)
* syntax_regression.py            (using various effect plot .csv files from "regression_datasets")
* typology.py                     (using typology.csv and "/WALS/values.csv")

One of these files makes use of a csv file generated in "tables_scripts":

* loanword_fields.py              (using loanwords_italic.csv)

These scripts are used to generate their eponymous csv figures in "tables":

* adjective_summary.py            (using order_adjective_enriched.csv) TO WRITE
* ceipom_summary.py               (using CEIPoM)
